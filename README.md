# Qase

An autonomous QA agent that tests live websites in a real browser, built on
[`@cleanslate/sdk`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@cleanslate/sdk).

Paste a URL. Qase opens the site in Chromium, writes a test plan, works through
it, and files what breaks — while you watch the cursor move.

## Setup

```bash
npm install && npm run install-browser
```

Then start it:

```bash
npm start
```

Open http://localhost:5173, click **Settings**, and fill in three fields:

| Field | What it is |
| --- | --- |
| API key | Your key |
| Base URL | The root your client appends `/chat/completions` to. Include `/v1` if your gateway expects it. |
| Model name | Exactly the id your endpoint expects |

Pick **custom** as the provider for any OpenAI-compatible endpoint. **Test
connection** probes it and loads the model list before you commit. Settings are
saved to `.qase/config.json`; `.env` works too, and the file wins over `.env`.

Nothing to test against yet? The server hosts a deliberately broken practice
site at http://localhost:5173/demo — sign in with `demo@qase.dev` / `demo1234`.

## The dashboard

**Left** — your runs. **Middle** — the conversation, with what the agent is
thinking pinned above the composer while it works. **Right** — the live browser
with the agent's cursor drawn over it, and tabs for Activity, Plan, Findings and
the Report.

The cursor and the highlight box are drawn over the video feed, not injected
into the page under test, so watching a run never changes what is being tested.

## Logging in

When the agent hits a login wall it stops and asks. Type the credentials into
the form that appears and they go into a server-side vault — **the model never
sees them**. It fills the form with `{{QA_USERNAME}}` and `{{QA_PASSWORD}}`, and
the real values are substituted at the keyboard. Anything that leaks back
through a page snapshot or an error is masked before it reaches the model or
the screen.

Credentials are held in memory only. They are never written to disk and are
gone when the server stops.

## What the agent may do

It has browser automation and nothing else — no filesystem, no shell, no
network tools. The permission gate refuses everything outside that list
regardless of what the model asks for.

It is told to test, not to damage: no deleting data, no changing account
settings, no sending messages, no completing a purchase. Where a flow can only
be tested by doing something irreversible, it stops and asks you instead.

You are pointing an autonomous agent at a real website. Point it at sites you
own or are authorised to test.

## Configuration

Everything below has a sensible default; set them in `.env` only if you need to.

| Variable | Default | What it does |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `PORT` | `5173` | Server port |
| `QASE_HEADLESS` | `true` | `false` also opens a visible browser window |
| `QASE_CURSOR_DWELL_MS` | `420` | How long the cursor is shown travelling to its target. Deliberate latency, so a run is watchable. `0` disables it. |
| `QASE_NAV_SETTLE_MS` | `1600` | How long a click waits for a client-side router before the URL is reported |
| `QASE_FRAME_INTERVAL_MS` | `320` | Live view frame interval |
| `QASE_FRAME_QUALITY` | `55` | Live view JPEG quality |
| `QASE_BROWSER_IDLE_MS` | `0` | Close a session's browser after this long idle. `0` keeps it open for the whole session. Cookies and the current page are restored either way. |
| `QASE_MAX_TURNS` | `120` | Hard ceiling on agent turns per run |

## Sharing it

`npm run package` writes `qase-share.zip` — the source only, without
`node_modules`, your API key, or your run history. Send that.

Do **not** zip the folder as it stands: `.env` and `.qase/config.json` contain
your API key, and `.qase/sessions.json` contains everything you have tested.

Whoever receives it runs `npm install && npm run install-browser`, then
`npm start`, and enters their own endpoint under Settings.

## How it works

`@cleanslate/sdk` supplies the agent loop, the tool protocol and a Playwright
browser. This app adds four things around it:

- **A tool gate** (`server/agent.js`) that narrows 59 tools down to browser
  automation plus two of its own — `report_finding` and `finish_qa_report`.
- **A browser bridge** (`server/browserBridge.js`) that publishes where each
  action is about to land before performing it, so the run can be watched, and
  waits for client-side navigation to settle before reporting a URL.
- **A credential vault** (`server/secrets.js`) that keeps secrets out of the
  model's context entirely.
- **The dashboard** (`public/`), which renders one SSE stream.
